# GDB Baby Step 1  

Description:
Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register at the end of the `main` function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`.

GDB -> GNU Debugger 

In this challenge I was given a file called `debugger0_a`. 

I found which type of file it was using the `file` command. 

In order to find the `eax` register, I had to first look at the Assembly code of the file. 
I found out using the Internet, that I had to use the built in Linux tool called `gdb` to disassemble the code to return a dump of the assembler code for the function `main`. 

The commands I used for the same are as follows:

```bash
chmod +x debugger0_a # Could not disassemble without root permissions

gdb debugger0_a
```

`gdb` commands:
```text
(gdb) disassemble main 
```

This is how the Assembler code for the function `main` looked like:

On further inspection, I could clearly see what the register for `eax` function contained. 

This is what it contained: 
`$0x86342`

On converting `0x86342` to binary, I got `549698`, which was the answer for the given challenge. 

Final answer: `picoCTF{549698}`
