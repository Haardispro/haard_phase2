# Phishing - Merry Clickmas 

### Objective 1: 

**Find Password for root access**

- Files `server.py` and `index.html` were given. 
- Using `setoolkit`, I had to deliver the phishing site using a legitimate email id, to our target
- I had to first send a phishing mail using `setoolskit`, the process was well laid out on the website.
- After sending the phishing mail, I ran the `script.py` provided.
- The password was then leaked to the terminal
- `unranked-wisdom-anthem`

### Objective 2:

**Check if password is reused and number of toys to be shipped**

- Now I logged in to the real server and logged in as the `factory` user and the password was actually reused for this account as well.
- Now I went into unread mails, where the number of toys were mentioned to be `1984000`
- Number of Toys: `1984000`


### Tools used:

- Used `setoolkit` -> Used for social engineering attacks
