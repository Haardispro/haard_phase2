## Log analysis with Splunk 

Splunk is a platform for collecting, storing, and analysing machine data. It provides various tools for analysing data, including search, correlation, and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organisations of all sizes can use to improve their IT operations and security posture.


The two datasets are as follows:

- `web_traffic`: This data source contains events related to web connections to and from the web server.
- `firewall_logs`: This data source contains the firewall logs, showing the traffic allowed or blocked. The local IP assigned to the web server is `10.10.1.15`.
