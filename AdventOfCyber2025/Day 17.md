# CyberChef - Hoperation Save McSkidy 

### Core Concepts:

- **Encoding:** a method to transform data to ensure compatibility between different systems. It prioritizes usability and speed (e.g., `Base64`) over security.
- **Encryption:** differs from encoding by focusing on security and confidentiality, using algorithms and keys (e.g., `TLS`).
- **Decoding:** the process of converting encoded data back to its original, readable, and usable form.
- **CyberChef:** known as the "Cyber Swiss Army Knife," it allows you to chain `Operations` into a `Recipe` to process `Input` into `Output`.
- **Inspecting Web Pages:** using browser **Developer Tools** allows you to view additional information beyond the rendered content of a web page.
